# More Urgent
* Add unit test for new functions.


# Less urgent
* Ability to read from S3 files
* Ability to have per-locus stutter model
* Multi-sample calling
* multithreading by locus
* to save memory, don't need to store read1 and read2 in ReadPair

# Make compiling easy
* Automatically check for necessary libraries (cppunit, gsl, nlopt)
* Make sure lib/htslib gets added to LD_LIBRARY_PATH somehow


# Done
* require minimum matching at read ends, at least for enclosing reads
* command line options for setting insert size, stutter, etc.
* option to automatically detect insert size parameters
* VCF output format
* Confidence intervals and/or quality scores
