# New features
* Ability to read from S3 files
* Ability to have per-locus stutter model
* Multi-sample calling
* multithreading by locus (or use built in multithreading of SSW/nlopt libraries)

# Make compiling easy
* Automatically check for necessary libraries (cppunit, gsl, nlopt)
* Make sure lib/htslib gets added to LD_LIBRARY_PATH somehow
* Shared library issues (error while loading shared libraries: libhts.so.2: cannot open shared object file)
* Fail gracefully when files (e.g. reference loci) not formatted correctly
