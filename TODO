# More Urgent
* Add unit test for new functions.
* require minimum matching at read ends, at least for enclosing reads
* command line options for setting insert size, stutter, etc.
* option to automatically detect insert size parameters
* Remove outlier insert sizes
* Make read length a global param rather than per-locus. Allow user to set or infer from first couple reads of BAM
* VCF output format

# Less urgent
* Ability to read from S3 files
* Ability to have per-locus stutter model
* Multi-sample calling
* multithreading by locus
* to save memory, don't need to store read1 and read2 in ReadPair
