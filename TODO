# Urgent
* require minimum matching at read ends, at least for enclosing reads
* command line options for setting insert size, stutter, etc.
* option to automatically detect insert size parameters
* Remove outlier insert sizes
* VCF output format

# Less urgent
* Multi-sample calling
* multithreading by locus
* to save memory, don't need to store read1 and read2 in ReadPair
