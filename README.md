# GangSTR

GangSTR is a tool for genome-wide profiling STRs and short VNTRs from short reads. A key advantage of GangSTR over existing tools (e.g. [lobSTR](https://github.com/mgymrek/lobstr-code) or [hipSTR](https://github.com/tfwillems/HipSTR)) is that it can handle repeats that are longer than the read length.

GangSTR takes aligned reads (BAM) and a set of repeats in the reference genome as input and outputs a VCF file containing genotypes for each locus.
